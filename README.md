# SQL_Daily_Practice

This repository contains my daily SQL practice queries, organized by topic and difficulty level.  
Itâ€™s designed to help me (and others) strengthen SQL skills for real-world data analysis and technical assessments.



- **Basic Queries**  
  Simple `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT` queries to build strong fundamentals.

- **Basic Joins**  
  Inner joins, left joins, right joins, and cross joins with small example datasets.

- **Advanced Select**  
  Using `CASE`, subqueries, and advanced filtering for complex data extraction.

- **Aggregation**  
  Grouped calculations using `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING`.

- **Intermediate SQL**  
  Combining joins, aggregations, and subqueries to solve real-world-style problems.

- **Advanced SQL**  
  Window functions, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), query optimization techniques, and more.
