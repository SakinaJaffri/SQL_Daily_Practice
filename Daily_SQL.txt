FROM country c
INNER JOIN city cc
    ON c.code = cc.countrycode
WHERE continent = 'Asia';

Question 4#
Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
Input Format

The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:



Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

Sample Input


Answer:
SELECT 
    CASE
        WHEN (A + B <= C) OR (B + C <= A) OR (A + C <= B) THEN 'Not A Triangle'
        WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
        WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
        ELSE 'Scalene'
    END AS triangle
FROM TRIANGLES;

Question:

Question:
Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's  key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.:  actual - miscalculated average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.

Input Format

The EMPLOYEES table is described as follows:

Answer:
SELECT CEIL(AVG(SALARY) - AVG(REPLACE(SALARY, '0', ''))) FROM EMPLOYEES;



Question:
We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary * months worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as  space-separated integers.

Input Format

The Employee table containing employee data for a company is described as follows:

Answer:
select max(salary*months),count(*) 
from employee 
where (salary*months)=(select max(salary*months) from employee) ;
